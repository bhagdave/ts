# Version Control
The version control system bein gused is Git and it is hosted on github [https://github.com/bhagdave/Tenancy-Stream-Laravel.git](https://github.com/bhagdave/Tenancy-Stream-Laravel.git)

The process to follow is gitflow.  So any new work will be created on a feature branch and built and tested locally.  Once considered ready a Pull request will be created against the Master branch ready for a code review.  No pull request will be accepted without a code review.
