# Compiling Js & CSS
You will need to have node and npm installed.  The following instructions are for Ubuntu 18.04
..* Install node - sudo apt install nodejs
..* Install NPM - sudo apt install npm
..* Run 'npm install' in the project root
..* On my machine this failed so I also had to run 'npm install --save babel-runtime' to get it to work
..* npm run dev

As a note. The resources in resources/ folder then compiled to the public folder
